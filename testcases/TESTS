Test 1: Edge case where all edges are white, however, the second column/row and
second last column/row are all black. 

Answer 1: Expected that the implementation of
unblackedges does not change anything in this file, resulting in the
answer file being the same.

Test 2: Edge case where every corner is white. This is to target 
implementations that start by checking and recursing from the corners, 
instead of checking the whole edge. This is also to check whether the recursion
works and replaces black pixels connected to the edge.

Answer 2: Expected that the implementation checks all black pixels on edges
and that it converts the whole image to white as a result.

Test 3: General test case, for where black lines are connected to the edges.
Essentially, tests whether the recursion of the implementation works correctly
and replaces all black pixels connected to edges to white. One black pixel is
disconnected from the edges in this image.

Answer 3: Expected that the entire image is white except for that one black
pixel that is not connected to the black edges.
